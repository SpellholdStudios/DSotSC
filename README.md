## Introduction

This is a WeiDU-based version of the original TeamBG mod.  This is only compatible with BGT-WeiDU (with or without BP-WeiDU, NeJ, SoBH or BG1NPC) and EET. If you're interested in a TUTU or BG:EE version of this mod, have a look at 
[TeamBG.com](http://www.baldursgatemods.com/forums/index.php?board=146.0)
It can be installed anytime after you completely install the BGT-WeiDU or EET game. See FAQ below for installation order suggestions. It is recommended that you choose NOT to BIFF the game resources while installing BGT but at the end of all installed mods using Generalized Biffing.

Post in the Mod's Forum at Spellhold Studios forum if you have issues/problems. Neither Sir BillyBob, erebusant, Turambar, nor k4thos maintain this mod any longer.

## Content

The mod starts after you complete the Cloakwood Mines.  Return to the Friendly Arms Inn to meet with Jet'laya.  As in the original DSotSC mod, other areas are also modified, so some parts to this mod you may see before Chapter 5.

#### More common encounters in vanilla areas:
This component will add more encounters with monsters in seveal original areas.

#### Distribute DSotSC items also in vanilla content:
This component will distribute new items from DSotSC throughout the game into creature inventories, chests, and various shops.
