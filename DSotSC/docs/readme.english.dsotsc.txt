INTRODUCTION
++++++++++++

This is a WeiDU-based version of the original TeamBG mod.  This is only compatible with BGT-WeiDU (with or without BP-WeiDU, NeJ, SoBH or BG1NPC) and EET. If you're interested in a TUTU or BG:EE version of this mod, have a look at TeamBG.com: http://www.baldursgatemods.com/forums/index.php?board=146.0 
It can be installed anytime after you completely install the BGT-WeiDU or EET game. See FAQ below for installation order suggestions. It is recommended that you choose NOT to BIFF the game resources while installing BGT but at the end of all installed mods using Generalized Biffing.

Post in the Mod's Forum at Spellhold Studios forum if you have issues/problems. Neither Sir BillyBob, erebusant, Turambar, nor k4thos maintain this mod any longer.

HISTORY
+++++++

The mod starts after you complete the Cloakwood Mines.  Return to the Friendly Arms Inn to meet with Jet'laya.  As in the original DSotSC mod, other areas are also modified, so some parts to this mod you may see before Chapter 5.

INSTALLATION
++++++++++++

NOTE: If you've previously installed the mod, remove it before extracting a new version. To do this, uninstall all previously installed components and delete the mod folder and executables.
Make sure the game is not running while installing the mod.
When installing or uninstalling, do not close the DOS window by clicking on the X button! Instead, press the Enter key when instructed to do so.

For Enhanced Edition it is important that you istall the mod to the language version you are playing the game in. Otherwise, the dialogues of the mod will not show but give error messages.
The EE games are actively supported games. Please note that every patch update will wipe your current mod setup! If in the middle of a modded game you might want to delay the patch update as even after reinstalling the mods, you might not be able to continue with your old savegames. 

Windows
Extract the contents of the mod archive to your game's main directory (BG:EE/SOD/BG2/BGT/BGII:EE/EET). On successful extraction, there should be an DSotSC folder and a setup-DSotSC.exe file in your game folder. To install, simply double-click setup-DSotSC.exe and follow the instructions on screen.
Run setup-DSotSC.exe in your game folder to reinstall, uninstall or otherwise change components.

Mac OS X
The mod is packaged and installed with WeiDU. To install, extract the mod archive, then copy of the contents of the folder into your game folder (the folder which contains the CHITIN.KEY file). If properly extracted, you should have a "DSotSC" folder, setup-DSotSC, and setup-DSotSC.command in your game folder. To install, simply double-click setup-DSotSC.command and follow the instructions on screen. 

Linux
Extract the contents of the mod to the folder of the game you wish to modify. Download the latest version of WeiDU for Linux from https://github.com/WeiDUorg/weidu/releases and copy WeiDU and WeInstall to /usr/bin. Following that, open a terminal and cd to your BG2 installation directory, run 'tolower' and answer Y to both queries. You can avoid running the second option (linux.ini) if you've already ran it once in the same directory. If you're unsure, running tolower and choosing both options is the safe bet.
Run WeInstall DSotSC in your game folder to install the mod. Then run wine BGMain.exe and start playing. 


OPTIONAL COMPONENTS
+++++++++++++++++++

DSotSC Wizard Spells:
This component will install the new spells of this mod.

DSotSC Priest Spells: 
This component will install the new priest spells.

More common encounters in vanilla areas:
This component will add more encounters with monsters in seveal original areas.

Distribute DSotSC items also in vanilla content:
This component will distribute new items from DSotSC throughout the game into creature inventories, chests, and various shops.


WALKTHROUGH
This walkthrough might be slightly outdated.
+++++++++++

Jet'Laya's Quest:

   Go to the Friendly Arm Inn map. Jet'laya will seek you out if you head to the southern portion of the map. Take up her quest to find her sister and have her join your party. As soon as you do, the Forest of the Forgotten Souls maps should highlight on your world map, and the Dark Side intro program will run. This is similar to your dream programs in between chapters.
   To access the LS maps you need to go through Peldvale. People have trouble finding the access, so the co-ordinates are x=5020, y=638, map 2400. Co-ordinate access is achieved by pressing the "L" key on your keyboard, and it pinpoints the location of your mouse pointer. There are 3 LS maps. The first is inconsequential. On the second map, you must observe the phantoms doing battle for a while. Just stand and watch. Nothing happens, but it is a prerequisite for what will come. Be very careful on these maps, as undead exist that can and will suck your experience and levels. Quick save after each little battle, AFTER you have checked that you haven't been sucked for XP. If you have, resume from the previous quick save. This will save you a world of grief.
   Enter the last LS map at night. As close to midnight is best.  You also need to clear out the undead nasties that are located in a cavern in the north central portion of this map. Now you have to search for Jet's sister. She is pretty close to the cavern that you cleaned out. You know you are close when you hear wailing and moaning.
   When you find her, Jet will engage in conversation and ask if you still want to help. You better say "yes" else you are screwed. On her sister's body is a necklace of importance. Right click on it for a very helpful game hint.

The Dark One:

   After you polish off the sister, the Dark One quest is normally next up. The Dark One quest does not find you (as all of the other quests do). When you finish Jet's quest, walk back to the map where the phantoms and cabin are located. Sometimes the phantom will talk to you, and sometimes you have to talk to the phantom. The Dark One is located very close by, so it takes very little time to complete; however the battle is of epic proportion. You will find that you have to kill the Dark One (be careful as he teleports away, and this does not count as a kill), and then the phantom will ask what's taking so long. He then informs you that you need the Dark One's life essence that is located within the cabin (this is the trigger for the cabin access). Get the stuff from the cabin (which the Dark One may be guarding from the outside), kill the Dark One again, and pick up the 6 potions that are on his body. Take the 6 potions to the phantom and everyone is happy (except the Dark One, as he's dead). Be careful not 
to kill the phantom in all of the battling. He is vulnerable to attacks after the first time he talks to you. He is also affected by turning undead, so be careful if you use this power.
   Upon finishing this battle (and finding some very cool treasure), make sure you return Jet's sister's necklace (the tear necklace) to her family member located in the Jovial Juggler Inn (Beregost). He will give you a letter that allows you to have a special mace made. Take the letter to the Thunder Hammer smithy weapon shop. Otho will commence the construction of the mace, which will take 5 days.

The Dragon Quest: 

   A worker from the Temple of Lathander should approach you and tell you to go to the Burning Wizard Inn. You will meet the MorningLord priest of Lathander. He says that he has recently lost a religious relic, and you are to return it to him. Accept the quest, then go to the Nashkell Inn. You will meet Jeremy (mayor's assistant), who asks if you will vanquish the dragon. Also at the Nashkell Inn is Strongblade. He asks to join your party to help slay the dragon. You might have to wait a few minutes in the Inn, as Strongblade enters from the rear room area AFTER you have decided to take on the dragon quest. Now you're off to the races.
   On the way to the dragon map (just south and east of Nashkell), you will meet a halfling thief. He is a decent thief, and you can ditch Imoen if you want. He also carries 6 or 7 arrows of green dragon slaying.
   Upon approaching the dragon (east central area of the map), you will encounter numerous gnolls that do nothing but piss you off as you get ready to do serious battle. Try and kill them off without initiating the dialogue with the dragon.
   As for battle tactics against the overgrown lizard, I will leave that up to you.
   After you kill the dragon, you need to find his hoard. The access is located a little to the west, on a mountain facing (still within view of where the dragon was sitting). You need to find the hoard, as that is where the religious relic is located, along with more cool treasure. If anyone in your party is proficient with battle axe, you will love the weapon in the hoard.
   Now you return to Nashkell to return the religious relic to the cleric , as well to get your rep. points from Jeremy (the mayor's assistant). On the way a little girl will approach you. You have to be nice to her *evil character grimaces* and then the game goes on autopilot as everyone gets taken to the mayor's house. You now regain control of your game, enter the mayor's house, and talk to the mayor's wife about her missing child. Ask who had access to the child.

The Citadel Quest: 

   You resume heading back to Beregost to return the relic and get your rep. points. Outside of the Nashkell Inn is a lady that tells you about a lost necklace just to the north. Help her out. On the way you meet C Choinneach and his dog. He fills you in on the child/vampire issues, and the Citadel should now appear on your map.
   In the interim is the special mace. You should have had this put into production (as it is made by Otho at the weapon smith's shop). You go to pick it up, and when you exit the shop, Elminster talks to you and empowers the mace. He then says you should have it blessed by a cleric.
   You remember that after you returned the religious relic to the priest of Morningwhatever, he said if you ever need anything, you can find him at the temple, located just east of the Friendly Arm Inn. You go there, have him bless the mace, and now you can go to the Citadel. You find the access on the east boundary of the map that you fought the dragon.
   If you thought there were a lot of undead on Jet's quest, you haven't seen anything yet! It is highly recommended that you keep Jet for this quest (but not essential). Jet and C Choinneach make a dynamite front line against the undead.
   After numerous levels of the Citadel (don't forget the upper levels, as there is a +3 vorpal weapon hidden in the top level chimney stack) you will encounter the baby sitter. Demand the return of the baby, and prepare yourself for battle. There is some dialogue with C Choinneach and the vampire, and after a few spells, the head vampire buggers off.
   After more undead battling, you should find him (and another vampire) waiting for you not too far away (end of a long corridor).  He will run away and you have a bit of search ahead of you.
   You will find the map that is the template for the basement of the Candlekeep map. There are several corridors that are seriously trapped, but contain great treasure. There is one corridor that appears to be a dead end - BUT it is not. You will find stairs going down. Take them after you have cleared the remaining areas.
   This lower level is maze like and contains more, you guessed it, undead. You have to meander around to the north, west, south and then back east to get where you want to go. The head nasty (and maybe the babysitter) are located in the small area furthest to the east. After you finally kill them, there is an access on the east side of this small area that leads to nice treasure - but don't forget to bring the baby back. Pick up the two stakes in the treasure pile. Go back up one level and head north out the main corridor.  Go through the maze of caverns heading east. A small room here contains two coffins.  Stake the vampires and get your XP.  Don't forget the trapped chest.
   If you have killed any of these nasties previously, it is possible to get numerous babies, but don't worry, it doesn't affect the quest. Bring the baby back to his mother and get the rep. points.

Otho's Nephew: 

   The next (and last) quest begins with you being summoned to the Hammer smithy shop again. Otho (who made your mace) is looking for his nephew. He went missing somewhere between Beregost and Nashkell. Obviously, take up the quest.
   You are looking for a campfire that is located on one of the maps indicated. It is just to the left of the main road. There is an access somewhat concealed (not hidden) on the mountain rock face just to the left of the campfire.
   What will follow is a whole host of maps until you find a map that looks like the main floor of the Flaming Fist headquarters (in BG). SAVE THE GAME IMMEDIATELY. As you enter the room you will find Trollslayer doing battle with about 50 Duragar (underground dwarves). He will ask if you want to help him. Duh, say yes. When the fight is over talk to Trollslayer (awesome Dwarven fighter) and have him join your group. He will tell you that "the bastards killed the nephew," but will want to investigate the unnatural recent goings-on.
   You will go through seemingly endless mazes, and will encounter the Drow leader. This battles are great, and I'll let you figure out how to deal with them on your own. It is stressed that on all of the maps that you venture through, that you look for ALL accesses. There are a few that wouldn't expect to find. Search for them all, as there is a pile of treasure just waiting to be had.
   You now have to venture back (very long walk unless you found the Bandit Camp access) and tell Otho about his nephew. He takes the war hammer that Trollslayer has and guess what? You have now finished the Dark Side quests. As a word of advise, read all of the books that you find in the Drow leaders quarters, one of them has some interesting facts about the game.

Side Quests and changes:

Several area maps have new monsters to fight.  Some areas will respawn new monsters after each chapter.
Temples, inns, and stores have new items.  Take a look and bring your gold.
Additional changes can be seen if you install NTotSC (Northern Tales of the Sword Coast).

F.A.Q.
++++++

     No, This will not work with a BGT-BP game; use the WeiDU versions.

3.  How can I update the mod? Can I use [R]e-install?
     If you have DSotSC v 215 or below installed, you can't. You must first uninstall the whole mod, then remove the DSotSC folder, and only then install a newer version.
