   depending on the OS

  - dsclub01 had wrong animation sequence probabilities (all values set to 0)
  - dsfordra.baf: removed some *Spell actions which had no valid spell: http://www.shsforums.net/topic/52117-big-world-project-bwp-v102-released/page__view__findpost__p__525072
  - a bug in wb_ext_sounds caused Extended NPC soundsets to fail unless Interparty banters was installed
